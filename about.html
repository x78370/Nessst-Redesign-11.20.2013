				<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
				<p>If you haven't heard about Addys (Design Ad Awards for Students and Professionals), Preflight (Student Portfolio Review by Design Professionals), Red Shoe Event (Fundraising Event/Student Draw-off Opportunity), or Terrain (One night of art, music, and design all under one roof) then you are missing out! These are only a few events that happen every so often but are super important to the Spokane Design Community and we want Eastern students to be more apart of. Head over to the Spokane Ad Fed site here to learn more about Addys, Preflight, and Red Shoe. </p>
